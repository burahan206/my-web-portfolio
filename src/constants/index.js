export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hello, my name is Burhan. I graduated from Srinakharinwirot University with a degree in Logistics Engineering. I have an interest and experience in developing web applications, both front-end and back-end. I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and React.js, and have experience working with MySQL and MongoDB databases.

Since graduating, I have continued to pursue my interest in programming by self-studying during my free time. However, I feel that I still have room for improvement, which is why I decided to join the Generation Bootcamp to further develop my skills. My interest in this field was sparked by working on mini-projects related to programming; I felt a great sense of satisfaction when the programs I created could be put to practical use.`
